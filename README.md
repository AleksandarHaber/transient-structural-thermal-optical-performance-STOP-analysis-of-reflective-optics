# transient-structural-thermal-optical-performance-STOP-analysis-of-reflective-optics
This code repository contains COMSOL Multiphysics and MATLAB files used to perform transient (time-dependent) Structural Thermal Optical Performance (STOP) analysis of reflective optics. We perform the transient STOP analysis of a Newtonian telescope.
